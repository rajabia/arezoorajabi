### Academic Projects

* **Image Privacy (2019-Present)** \
*Practical Adversarial Perturbation for Image Privacy* Image hosting platforms are a popular way to store and share images with family members and friends. 
However, such platforms typically have full access to images raising privacy concerns.
These concerns are further exacerbated with the advent of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that can be trained on available images to automatically detect and recognize faces with high accuracy.
In this project, we  proposed two practical adversarial perturbation approaches for image privacy. Our paper for image privacy got accepted in Privacy Enhancing Technology symposium (PETs).

* **Robust Convolutional Neural Networks**


* **Complex Netwok Analysis**\

  *Local Community Detection  in Complex Networks and Sampling form Social Networks*
  
  *Social Networks Topology Inference Using Diffusion Information*

* **Power Systems Cyberbersecurity** \
Standard Alternating Direction of Multipliers Method (S-ADMM) and Distributed Alternating Direction of Multipliers Method (D-ADMM)  have been proposed to detect  oscillations in distributed power systems. Unfortunately, these two methods are vulnerable to false data injection attack. In this project, we proposed  two resiliency mechanisms for S-ADMM and D-ADMM that have been published in IEEE SmartGridComm and ICSS. This project was funded by Cyber Resilient Energy Delivery Consortium (CREDC) and National Science Foundation (NSF).


### Industrial Project

* **Data anonymization and synthesis (problem submitted by Desjardins** \
Issues surrounding the protection of personal data are garnering more and more attention in society. Machine learning requires big data as well as granular data: thus it involves challenges, especially the protection of personal data and the transformation of data so that they cannot be traced to individuals. In this project, we investigated  practices for anonymizing or synthesizing data that allows retain as many "original data" features as possible  which is required to develop good predictive models.
