### Academic Research Projects

* **Image Privacy (2019-Present)** 
   - *Practical Adversarial Perturbation for Image Privacy:* Image hosting platforms are a popular way to store and share images with family members and friends. 
However, such platforms typically have full access to images raising privacy concerns.
These concerns are further exacerbated with the advent of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that can be trained on available images to automatically detect and recognize faces with high accuracy.
In this project, we  proposed two practical adversarial perturbation approaches for image privacy. Our paper for image privacy got accepted in Privacy Enhancing Technology symposium (PETs).

* **Robust Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (2017-2020)**

   - *Detect and Reject Adversarial Examples:* Detection and rejection of adversarial examples in security sensitive and safety-critical systems using deep CNNs is essential. In this projecr, We aimed to detect and reject or classify adversarial examples correctly. To this end we proposed three methods:
   
  
      1. Using influence of diversity in the ensemble of CNNs on the detection of black-box adversarial instances and hardening the generation of white-box adversarial attacks. To this end, we proposed an ensemble of diverse specialized CNNs along with a simple voting mechanism. The diversity in this ensemble creates a gap between the predictive confidences of adversaries and those of clean samples, making adversaries detectable. 
      
      2. Learning augment CNNs with out-distribution learning in order to reduce misclassification rate by rejecting adversarial examples. We empirically show that our augmented CNNs can either reject or classify correctly most adversarial examples generated using well-known methods (> 95% for MNIST and> 75% for CIFAR-10 on average). Furthermore, we achieve this without requiring to train using any specific type of adversarial examples and without sacrificing the accuracy of models on clean samples significantly (< 4%).
     
   
   - *Out-distribution Ranking for Leaning Robust CNNs:*  We proposed  learning Augmented CNNs on out-distribution samples as a simple and effective solution rejecting thise samples. However adding all posible OOD set to training set is not possible. In other words, a critical question remains unanswered in this work: how to select an OOD set, among the available OOD sets, for training such CNNs that induces high detection rates on unseen OOD sets? We address this pivotal question through the use of Augmented-CNN (A-CNN) involving an explicit rejection option. We first provide a formal definition to precisely differentiate OOD sets for the purpose of selection. As using this definition incurs a huge computational cost, we propose novel metrics, as a computationally efficient tool, for characterizing OOD sets in order to select the proper one. 


* **Complex Netwok Analysis (2010-2013)**

  - *Local Community Detection  in Complex Networks and Sampling form Social Networks*   [Chaos Paper](http://coinlab.ut.ac.ir/documents/17321997/30927624/Sampling%20from%20Complex%20Networks%20with%20High%20Community%20Structures.pdf), [Local Community Detection Report] (./projects/ArezooRajabi.LCD-RW.pdf)
  
  - *Social Networks Topology Inference Using Diffusion Information* 

* **Power Systems Cyberbersecurity (2016-2019)** 

   - *False Data Tolerance Mechanisms for Distributed Mode Estimation:* Standard Alternating Direction of Multipliers Method (S-ADMM) and Distributed Alternating Direction of Multipliers Method (D-ADMM)  have been proposed to detect  oscillations in distributed power systems. Unfortunately, these two methods are vulnerable to false data injection attack. In this project, we proposed  two resiliency mechanisms for S-ADMM and D-ADMM that have been published in IEEE SmartGridComm and ICSS. This project was funded by Cyber Resilient Energy Delivery Consortium (CREDC) and National Science Foundation (NSF).


### Industrial Project

* **Data Anonymization and Synthesis (problem submitted by Desjardins- 2020)** \
Issues surrounding the protection of personal data are garnering more and more attention in society. Machine learning requires big data as well as granular data: thus it involves challenges, especially the protection of personal data and the transformation of data so that they cannot be traced to individuals. In this project, we investigated  practices for anonymizing or synthesizing data that allows retain as many "original data" features as possible  which is required to develop good predictive models.

### Hobby Projects


### Coursework Projects

* **Knowledge Discovery in Relational Databases (CS 540)** The main objective of this project was to learn new concept from structured dataset such as relational database. We studied the behavior of three relational machine learning algorithm including First Order Inductive Logic (FOIL) , Top-Down Inductive Decision Tree (TILDE) and Mixture Model Membership. The results show that the TILDE algorithm performs better than FOIL algorithm, etc. [Report](./projects/ProjectProposalCS540.pdf), [Slides](./projects/CS540Presentation.pdf)
