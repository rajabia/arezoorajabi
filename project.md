* Image Privacy in Image Sharing Platforms 2019-Present \

Image hosting platforms are a popular way to store and share images with family members and friends. 
However, such platforms typically have full access to images raising privacy concerns.
These concerns are further exacerbated with the advent of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that can be trained on available images to automatically detect and recognize faces with high accuracy.
In this project, we  proposed two practical adversarial perturbation approaches for image privacy. Our paper for image privacy got accepted in Privacy Enhancing Technology symposium (PETs).
