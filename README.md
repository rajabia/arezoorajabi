### Bio

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science and Graduate Research Assistant at Oregon State University (OSU), specializing in Image Privacy and intersection of Machine Learning and Cybersecurity under supervision of [Prof. Rakesh B. Bobba](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/people/bobba-rakesh).  I am a dedicated and passionate ML researcher and so eager to work on new topics and recently emerged challenges with the ability to work independently and in a team environment. I enjoyed my collaboration with [Prof. Wuchi Feng](https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~wuchi/) and [Prof. Charles Wright](https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~cvwright/) at Portland State University on my image privacy project and with [Mahdieh Abbasi](http://mahdane.github.io), Ph.D. student of Univertie' Laval in Quebec, on our dependable and secure deep neural networks project.  I also spent two years of my Ph.D. on improving the distributed mode estimation of standard and dynamic alternative direction method of multipliers in power systems for tolerating false data injection attack. I got my Masters and Bachelors degrees in Computer Engineeing and Computer Science at Sharif University of Technology. During my master, I worked on some fun and exciting projects on complex networks analysis methods and graph theories at [Digital Media Lab](http://dml.ce.sharif.edu/dmlsite/?q=people) collabrating with talented undergrad, grad students. In general, my research areas of intrerest are:

* **Machine Learning & Deep Learning** 
* **Data Science & Statistical Analysis** 
* **Data & Image Privacy** 
* **Complex Networks Analysis & Graph Mining** 
* **Cybersecurity**
