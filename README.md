### Bio

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science and a Graduate Research Assistant at Oregon State University (OSU), working on Image Privacy and intersection of Machine Learning and Cybersecurity under supervision of [Prof. Rakesh B. Bobba](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/people/bobba-rakesh). I  am collabrating with  [Prof. Wuchi Feng](https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~wuchi/) and [Prof. Charles Wright](https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~cvwright/) at Portland State University on my image privacy project. In this project we are exploring  the practical adversarial perturbations for image privacy in image sharing platforms. I also worked with 
 [Mahdieh Abbasi](http://mahdane.github.io), Ph.D. student of Univertie' Laval in Quebec, on our dependable and secure deep neural networks project in which we tended to detect and reject adversarial and out-distribution examples. I worked as gradurate research assistant at [Digital Media Lab](http://dml.ce.sharif.edu/dmlsite/?q=people)  on some fun and exciting projects on complex networks analysis methods and graph theories. I received my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Computer Engineeing and Computer Science at Sharif University of Technology. In general, my research areas of intrerest are:

* **Machine Learning & Deep Learning** 
* **Data Science & Statistical Analysis** 
* **Data & Image Privacy** 
* **Complex Networks Analysis & Graph Mining** 
* **Cybersecurity**
